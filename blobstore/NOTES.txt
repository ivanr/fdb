- Implement a good read interface

- Use at least one Directory, or many Directories to store buckets?

- Use nicer keys; no need to use tuples

- Optimize transactions

- Add support for blob attributes

- After a failed upload, cleanup partial data

- Listing operation will fail if transaction limits are exceeded

- If we read across transactions, it's possible that the underlying blob changes;
  if we switch to unique blob identifiers that won't be an issue. The worse that
  could happen is that a blob is deleted.

- How do we atomically update/replace blobs? Use indirection? On a related note,
  we have no protection for concurrent access.

- Option to control if an existing blog will be overwritten

- Add support for buckets

- TTL, bucket size limits (FIFO)

- For portability, use JSON to serialize blob metadata
